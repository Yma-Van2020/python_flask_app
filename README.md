# speaking for Pets - Pet Adoption App

This is a pet adoption app aiming to provide a smooth user experience and give easy acceess to the Petfinder API. After registration, a verification email with a confirmation link will be sent to the user's inbox. It can be resent if expired. Users can choose to view the information of listed animals and start an adoption application. If the pet has been adopted, the application would not go through. Users can search for local pets available for adoption from the Petfinder API. Users can either check out the pet's profile, start an application or add certain pets into their watchlist.
