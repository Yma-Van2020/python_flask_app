    <p>
        Please note due to the current COVID-19 pandemic our adoption process has changed. All adoptions are by appointment only once we have received an application.

***Due to the high number of applications we receive for our animals, we will only be contacting potential adopters to further review their application***

Shadow is a larger boy at only 1 year of age. All the more to LOVE! He came from a home that had too many pets, so another cat in the home would be all right and he’s also lived with a dog. As most new arrivals, he is finding the shelter life a little overwhelming. He’s a wee bit nervous and hiding. His behaviour will change once comfortable in a caring and loving home. He may require some safe, outdoor access.
