        Meet Gilbert!
This handsome boy came into the care of the BC SPCA with a large wound on his neck. It has been treated and is healing nicely but he is looking for a very cat experienced, adult only home, with someone who can read his signs as sometimes he can become overstimulated. Gil will need to be the sole kitty of his domain as he has let us know he is not a fan of other animals. He is a chatty boy who is very affectionate but also is fine chilling out on his own.

Before Gil was neutered, he suffered from urethral spasms causing him to be unable to urinate. He is now recovering well from this, but will require ongoing monitoring throughout his life. Staff members can further discuss his care with potential adopters.

As with any new furry family member, We would recommend starting him off in a smaller, enclosed area of your home so that he can get used to all the new sounds and smells of his new environment. Changes can be quite overwhelming to some kitties and it would be best to let him settle in at his own pace. He would love nothing more than a family to call his own and a cat tree with a sunny spot to lounge in!

Will you be Gilbertâ€™s forever home? Please submit an online application for him today!
